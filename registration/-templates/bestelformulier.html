		The bare attendance fee for this event may be up to &euro;10,-. Please note
		that - unlike what you may be used to from Cover LANs - this does not 
		include dinner.
	</p>
	<p>
		You may order food independently or take your own, but representatives of
		each study association will be ordering food too. It's likely they have discounts.
		You are free to join them.
	</p>
	<p>
		You may optionally order computer transport service for an added fee of &euro;
		5,-. We will only transport your computer and related peripherals. Transport
		service can't be held responsible for damage to your equipment.
	</p>
	<p>
		Each study association has 20 seats for attendees. You may still register if all slots of your study association have been taken; we will contact you 5 days prior or sooner if a slot frees up for you at your study association, or at another.
